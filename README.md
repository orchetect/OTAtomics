Multi-platform Swift thread-safe atomics library.

The library has full unit test coverage and is actively used in production.

## Installation: Swift Package Manager (SPM)

### Dependency within an Application

1. Add the package to your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager
   - Select File ‚Üí Swift Packages ‚Üí Add Package Dependency
   - Add package using  `https://github.com/orchetect/OTAtomics` as the URL.
2. Import the module in your *.swift files where needed.
   ```swift
   import OTAtomics
   ```

### Dependency within a Swift Package

1. In your Package.swift file:

   ```swift
   dependencies: [
       .package(url: "https://github.com/orchetect/OTAtomics", from: "1.0.0")
   ],
   ```
   
2. Using `internal import` prevents the methods and properties in `OTOperations` from being exported to the consumer of your SPM package.

   ```swift
   internal import OTAtomics
   ```

## Documentation

Most methods are implemented as category methods so they are generally discoverable.

All methods have inline help explaining their purpose and basic usage examples.
